**Follow Me Project**

The goals of this project are the following:
* Understand the network architecture.
* Choose appropriate parameters of FCN
* Try 1 by 1 convolutions and fully conncted layer
* Manipulate Images in accordance with Network Limitation
* Understand the limitation of the current network architecutre


##  ##

In this project, you will train a deep neural network to identify and track a target in simulation. So-called “follow me” applications like this are key to many fields of robotics and the very same techniques you apply here could be extended to scenarios like advanced cruise control in autonomous vehicles or human-robot collaboration in industry.



**Ideas for Improving your Score**

Collect more data from the sim. Look at the predictions think about what the network is getting wrong, then collect data to counteract this. Or improve your network architecture and hyperparameters.
